None of our people ask for or receive remuneration for their service. Neither do we expect our team to foot the bill for our user base.

Money is a factor in our solutions. With your donation, we can foot the bill for things like mapbox keys, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and other hosted solutions that make it easier for recovery communities to set-up our tools and lower the barrier of entry for new groups.

If your are interested in donating or would like to know exactly what your money would be used for, please email info@code4recovery.org

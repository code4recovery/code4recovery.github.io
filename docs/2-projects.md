## Meeting Lists for Your Recovery Website: Any vice, any platform

We make it easy for anyone to publish meeting data in our easily read and widely recognized web interface. We call these solutions 12 Step Meeting List, or TSML.

Find your platform below.

### 12 Step Meeting List Wordpress Plugin `Production`

12 Step Meeting List (TSML) is an open-source WordPress plugin that helps recovery organizations list their local weekly meetings.

#### Key Features

- 700+ active installations
- Easiest way to include your area meetings on Meeting Guide App for iOS and android
- Pretty cool team

#### History

TSML entered production for Santa Clara County AA on May 2, 2014, and was made available on the WordPress Plugin Directory exactly one year later. It is currently in use by hundreds of recovery organizations.

### TSML UI `Production`

Publish and manage your area's recovery meetings for any web platform

#### Reason for being

We want the recovery community to be independent of web platform. TSML UI takes the basic meeting finder concepts established in TSML and renders the front-end user interface (UI). By using TSML UI, websites not running WordPress can still benefit from TSML's user-friendly, recognized interface.

Eventually, we envision TSML UI will become the default front-end for TSML.

#### What does TSML UI look like?

Check out the TSML UI [Demo](https://demo.code4recovery.org/tsml-ui).

#### Simple installation

TSML UI is an open source React web app available to anyone. Installation is slightly more involved than our Wordpress plugin, but we've boiled installation down to an easy copy-and-paste process. Even if you don't know how to read HTML or javascript, you'll still be able to install TSML UI.

Use our [Configuration helper](https://tsml-ui-config.netlify.app) to get started.

### Online Meeting List `Production`

Online Meeting List is a meeting finder front-end specifically designed for the needs of an international listing of online recovery meetings.

Its primary distinguishing characteristic is that it converts and sorts listings in the user's local timezone.

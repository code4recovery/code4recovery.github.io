Code for Recovery is a non-profit organization that develops awesome, open-source solutions to help the recovery community meet, organize and recover from addiction.

## Our History

We evolved out of the need for AA members to find meetings online.

Our founder, Josh R. developed initial versions of Meeting Finder, a mobile app for iOS and Android. He gave Meeting Finder to AA Global Services in 2019 but continued to work on Twelve-Step Meeting List (TSML) for Wordpress.

Our TSML solutions are critical to the functioning of recovery communities across the globe. With video conferencing and hybrid platforms common in today's meeting mix, meeting information has become more native to digital. TSML is used by more intergroups and users today than ever.

## Our Team

Other members have joined the project over the years. We are proud to say that 12 members joined our first meeting in 2022. More are always welcome!
